## 👤 Who Am I?


Hi, I’m Mohammad Raza Hakeem, a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience across security monitoring, penetration testing, malware analysis, and system hardening through extensive labs and capstone projects.

My work includes SIEM implementation and auditing using Sysmon and Elastic, malware forensic analysis and reporting, wireless traffic analysis with Wireshark, and internal and external penetration testing using Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, and Netcat. I’ve also configured and tested firewalls and IDS/IPS using pfSense and Snort, performed secure operating system installation and patch management, and hardened Windows and Linux systems.

I’ve worked with Active Directory and Group Policy, configured account policies and access controls, and applied NIST-aligned security practices across virtualized and cloud-based environments, including AWS EC2 fundamentals. I hold the CompTIA Security+, Google Cybersecurity, Google IT Support, and Microsoft IT Support Specialist certifications and earned my Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity Technology from the University of Maryland Global Campus.
